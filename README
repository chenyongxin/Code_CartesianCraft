Code_CartesianCraft
===================

Code_CartesianCraft (CCC) is an incompressible turbulent flow solver, which is 
used in my turbulent boundary layer simulations. The name CCC sounds stupid, 
but is easy to remember (I hope). 

CCC depends on HYPRE for the parallel Poisson solver and optionally depends on
HDF5 for parallel IO. One needs to enable the ``parallel'' feature when 
compiling HYPRE and HDF5. The paths to the header files and libraries should 
be appended to the environment variables CPATH and LIBRARY_PATH respectively. 
This is also applicable to build CCC with CMake. Then CCC can be compiled by 
``make -j'' with the provided Makefile or the CMake-generated Makefile.
